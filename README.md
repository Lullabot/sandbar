# Claude Code Development VM Playbook

Ansible playbook to provision a Debian 13 (trixie) VM as a Claude Code development environment.

## Prerequisites

- A fresh Debian 13 (trixie) minimal installation with SSH access as root
- Ansible installed on the control machine (`apt install ansible`)
- SSH key access to the target VM's root user

## Running the Playbook Directly on the Target Host

If you are running the playbook on the same machine you want to provision (i.e. no SSH hop), use Ansible's local connection mode. This is useful when bootstrapping the VM from within a post-install script or when SSH is not available.

1. Install Ansible on the target host:
   ```bash
   apt install ansible
   ```

2. Copy the example variables file and fill in your details:
   ```bash
   cp group_vars/all.yml.example group_vars/all.yml
   ```

3. Run the playbook with a local inventory and `--connection=local`:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i localhost, --connection=local site.yml
   ```

   The trailing comma after `localhost` tells Ansible to treat the value as an inline inventory rather than a file path.

   When done, run `source ~/.bashrc` or create a new shell to get updated PATH settings.

## Running against a remote host

1. Copy the example variables file and fill in your details:
   ```bash
   cp group_vars/all.yml.example group_vars/all.yml
   ```
   Edit `group_vars/all.yml` with your Git identity, GitHub username, and network settings.

2. Edit `inventory` and replace `CHANGE_ME` with the target VM's IP address:
   ```
   claude.example ansible_host=192.168.1.100 ansible_user=debian
   ```

3. Run the playbook:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml
   ```
   
## Quick start with Lima

The fastest way to get a VM is `scripts/new-vm.sh`. It prompts for the
required settings (with sensible autodetected defaults), then starts a Lima
instance that installs Ansible and runs this playbook against itself with
`--connection=local` — no manual cloning, inventory editing, or `ansible`
install required.

It works two ways from the same script:

- **Just want a VM** — run it without checking the repo out:

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deviantintegral/claude-code-ansible/main/install.sh | bash
  ```

  This clones the playbook into `~/.local/share/claude-code-ansible` (pinned
  to the latest release tag when one exists) and launches the VM from there.

- **Hacking on the playbook** — from a checkout, run the script directly:

  ```bash
  ./scripts/new-vm.sh
  ```

  In this mode the script mounts your **working tree**, so uncommitted edits
  provision the VM. Re-run it (or `limactl start <name>`) to re-apply the
  playbook; Ansible is idempotent, so it just re-converges.

Non-interactive use (CI, scripting) is supported via flags — see
`./scripts/new-vm.sh --help`. For example:

```bash
./scripts/new-vm.sh --yes --name claude \
  --git-name "Your Name" --git-email you@example.com \
  --keys-url https://github.com/your-username.keys
```

How it spins up the VM:

- It inherits Lima's shipped **`template:_images/debian-13`**, so Lima manages
  the image, architecture, and download cache. Nothing image-specific is
  committed to this repo.
- The VM is fully **ephemeral**: the only mount is the playbook, read-only.
  There is **no writable host mount** (not even the stock Lima host-home
  mount), so the VM cannot modify anything on your machine and
  `limactl delete <name>` provably removes everything it produced — important
  when the whole point is to throw away potentially compromised code. Move
  files in or out with `limactl copy`.
- Your answers are passed to Ansible as `--extra-vars`, so there is no
  `group_vars/all.yml` to maintain per VM; each instance is independent.

Prerequisites: [Lima](https://lima-vm.io/docs/installation/) (`limactl`), and
`git` for the `curl | bash` path.

### Running with lima-vm manually

If you prefer to drive Lima yourself instead of using the script:

```console
$ limactl create --name claude --cpus=8 --memory=32 template:debian-13
```

**It is highly recommended** to edit or disable the default mount of your home directory. Otherwise, nothing will stop Claude from making changes there.

## What It Does

- Sets hostname to `claude.lan` (configurable)
- Creates a user (default: `claude`) with passwordless sudo and SSH key access
- Installs development tools: Docker CE, ddev, Node.js, Go, Python 3, uv, mkcert, Java, and CLI utilities
- Installs the [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/) and configures it as the git credential helper for HTTPS authentication
- Installs Claude Code CLI configured for autonomous operation
- Optionally configures a Docker registry proxy for caching pulls
- Deploys tmux, git, and bashrc configurations

## GitHub Authentication

The playbook installs `gh` and configures it as the git credential helper so that `git push` and `git pull` over HTTPS work automatically. GitHub tokens are managed per-organization using direnv and the `github-org-setup` script.

### How it works

Each GitHub organization gets its own directory under `~/github.com/<org>/`. Inside that directory:

- A `.env` file sets `GH_TOKEN` for that org's repositories (loaded automatically by direnv)
- A `.gitconfig-<org>` file sets the git commit email for that org
- A gitconfig `includeIf` entry activates the per-org email when working in that directory

When you `cd` into `~/github.com/<org>/` (or any subdirectory), direnv loads the `.env` file and `GH_TOKEN` is set automatically. When you leave, it is unloaded. `GH_TOKEN` takes precedence over the credential stored by `gh auth login`, so per-org tokens work without conflicting with any default token.

### Setting up an organization during provisioning

Set the org variables in `group_vars/all.yml` or pass them on the command line:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml \
  --extra-vars "user_github_org=my-org user_github_org_email=me@my-org.com user_github_org_token=ghp_xxxx"
```

The playbook runs `github-org-setup` non-interactively to create the directory, token, email config, and direnv approval.

### Adding or updating organizations after deployment

SSH into the VM and run `github-org-setup`:

```bash
# Interactive mode — prompts for org, email, and token:
github-org-setup

# Non-interactive mode — org and email as flags, token via stdin:
echo "ghp_xxxx" | github-org-setup --org my-org --email me@my-org.com
```

Running the script again for an existing org overwrites the token and email configuration.

### Multiple organizations

You can set up as many organizations as you need. Each gets its own isolated directory and token:

```bash
github-org-setup   # set up lullabot
github-org-setup   # set up personal
```

This creates:

```
~/github.com/
  lullabot/
    .env           # GH_TOKEN for lullabot repos
  personal/
    .env           # GH_TOKEN for personal repos
```

Switching between directories automatically swaps the active token and git commit email.

### Recommended: Fine-grained Personal Access Tokens

Fine-grained PATs are recommended over classic PATs. They offer several advantages:

- **Scoped to specific repositories** — a token can only access the repos you choose
- **Granular permissions** — grant only the access each project needs
- **Mandatory expiration dates** — tokens cannot be created without an expiry

Create them at: **Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Fine-grained tokens**.

Commonly needed permissions:

| Permission | Access | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Contents | Read and write | Push and pull code |
| Pull requests | Read and write | Create and manage PRs |
| Issues | Read and write | Create and manage issues (if needed) |
| Metadata | Read-only | Always required (automatically included) |

For the best security posture, create a separate fine-grained token per organization or client.

## Security Model

This playbook creates a **disposable, single-purpose development VM** intended to be run by Claude Code as an autonomous coding agent. The security posture reflects this:

- **Passwordless sudo** is enabled for the configured user (default: `claude`). The VM is not intended to host multiple users or untrusted workloads.
- **Claude Code runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`**, allowing it to operate without interactive approval prompts. This is appropriate because the VM is ephemeral and isolated — it can be torn down and reprovisioned at any time.
- **A random password** is generated on each provision for SSH and Samba access. It is not stored persistently.

**Do not use this playbook to provision machines that hold sensitive data or are exposed to the public internet.** It is designed for an isolated LAN or virtual network where the VM is treated as disposable.

## Configurable Variables

Copy `group_vars/all.yml.example` to `group_vars/all.yml` and edit, or override via `--extra-vars`:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `user_name` | `claude` | Username for the primary system account |
| `base_hostname` | `claude` | VM hostname |
| `base_domain` | `lan` | Domain suffix (FQDN = hostname.domain) |
| `base_locale` | `en_CA.UTF-8` | System locale |
| `user_git_user_name` | `Your Name` | Git user.name |
| `user_git_user_email` | `you@example.com` | Git user.email (default) |
| `user_github_keys_url` | `https://github.com/your-username.keys` | SSH authorized_keys source |
| `user_github_org` | _(empty)_ | GitHub organization name for initial setup (e.g. `lullabot`) |
| `user_github_org_email` | _(empty)_ | Git commit email for the initial org |
| `user_github_org_token` | _(empty)_ | GitHub PAT for the initial org (fine-grained PATs recommended) |
| `devtools_docker_registry_proxy_enabled` | `false` | Enable Docker registry proxy |
| `devtools_docker_registry_proxy_host` | `docker-registry-proxy.example` | Docker registry proxy hostname |
| `devtools_docker_registry_proxy_port` | `3128` | Docker registry proxy port |
| `claude_code_oauth_token` | _(empty)_ | Long-lived OAuth token for headless Claude Code auth. Generate with `claude setup-token`. Treat as a secret — supply via `--extra-vars` or an Ansible vault, not source control |
| `claude_code_notifications_enabled` | `false` | Install Claude Code Stop / UserPromptSubmit / SessionEnd hooks that POST to a webhook |
| `claude_code_notifications_webhook_url` | _(empty)_ | Webhook URL the hooks POST to. Treat as a secret — supply via `--extra-vars` or an Ansible vault, not source control |

### Headless Claude Code authentication (optional)

By default the playbook does **not** provision a Claude Code credential — after provisioning you can SSH in and run `claude` to complete the normal interactive browser login, and `claude_code_oauth_token` can be left unset.

If you'd rather skip the interactive login (e.g. for fully unattended provisioning or CI), generate a long-lived OAuth token on an interactive machine and pass it to the playbook:

1. On any machine where you're already logged into Claude Code, run:

   ```bash
   claude setup-token
   ```

   This walks you through an OAuth authorization and prints a token (roughly one-year TTL) to the terminal. It is **not** saved anywhere — copy it immediately.

2. Supply it to the playbook via vault or `--extra-vars`:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml \
     --extra-vars "claude_code_oauth_token=sk-ant-oat01-..."
   ```

   The token is written to `~/.claude/claude-code.env` with mode `0600` and sourced from `~/.bashrc`, so every new shell exports `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` and Claude Code authenticates without a browser round-trip. The playbook also pre-seeds `~/.claude.json` with `hasCompletedOnboarding: true` so the first `claude` invocation skips the theme / trust / login flow entirely.

Notes:

- This is a distinct token from anything in `~/.claude/.credentials.json`. You cannot reuse an existing `accessToken` / `refreshToken` pair as `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` — only the output of `claude setup-token` works.
- `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` takes precedence over any credentials stored on disk, so re-running `claude login` is not needed.
- The token is bound to the account that ran `setup-token`. Revoke it from your Claude account settings if the VM is compromised or decommissioned.
- Do **not** commit the token to `group_vars/all.yml`. Use an Ansible vault (`ansible-vault encrypt_string`) or pass it on the command line.

### Webhook notifications (optional)

When `claude_code_notifications_enabled` is true, the playbook installs three hooks under `~/.claude/hooks/`:

- `notify-stop.sh` — fires on Claude Code's `Stop` event and POSTs a notification with the host, project, and last assistant message.
- `notify-clear.sh` — fires on `UserPromptSubmit` and `SessionEnd` and POSTs a `clear_notification` with the same `tag` so the prior notification is dismissed (Home Assistant Companion convention).

Each notification is tagged `claude-<host>-<session8>` so multiple concurrent sessions don't clobber each other. The webhook URL is read at runtime from `~/.claude/hooks/notify.env` (rendered from `claude_code_notifications_webhook_url`, mode `0600`); if the env file is missing or empty, the hooks exit silently.

To enable for a single run without committing the secret:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml \
  --extra-vars "claude_code_notifications_enabled=true claude_code_notifications_webhook_url=https://example.ui.nabu.casa/api/webhook/your-webhook-id"
```
